<!--truncate--></p>

<p>On my <a href="https://wiki.0x8c.org/courses/tcm-security/practical-web-application-and-security-testing">wiki</a>, I wrote about how to setup the tools you’ll need to setup the Web App Penetration Testing lab for the course from TCM Security. I pay monthly for it, and it is worth it. For $30 you get the whole smorgasboard of courses which is expanding all the time.</p>

<p>I’ve hopped around different ones and decided my first full course will be the web app pentest course.</p>

<h2 id="late-night-labs">Late night labs</h2>

<p>I’m now digging into the meat of the course and I am completely <em>hooked</em>. Taggert has given me just enough nuggets to allow me to customize Kali Linux to my liking and so I’ve got a lab that suits my aesthetics. If that doesn’t matter to you, I love that for you. But for me, it’s <em>gold</em>.</p>

<p>It is almost 3 AM and I should probably sleep. But I can’t wait to dive back into the lab in the morning…ish.</p>]]></content><author><name>Your Name</name><email>tiff-0x8c@proton.me</email></author><category term="pentest" /><category term="virtual lab" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full lab setup]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Simple Scripts: Beginning</title><link href="/simple-scripts-beginning/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Simple Scripts: Beginning" /><published>2023-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/simple-scripts-beginning</id><content type="html" xml:base="/simple-scripts-beginning/"><![CDATA[<p>I’m currently working through (and banging my head against) working with Python scripts to simulate pentesting techniques.</p>

<!--truncate-->

<p>I enjoy watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy">TCM Security YouTube channel</a> for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s entertaining</li>
  <li>It’s informative and current</li>
  <li>And it gives you ideas to help you stand out in a crowded pool of applicants in InfoSec</li>
</ol>

<p>The one video in particular stood out to me:</p>

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7FRIEURJ34" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>In it, The Cyber Mentor talks about having side projects to throw on your GitHub and as such, list on your resume.</p>

<p>I thought this was a <em>wonderful</em> idea, and while you don’t <em>need</em> to code to be in InfoSec, to stand out, it might be helpful.</p>

<p>Since I come from a software dev background, this felt like the right thing to do.</p>

<h2 id="its-cool-to-move-blazingly-fast-and-enshittify-things">It’s cool to move <em>blazingly fast</em> and enshittify things</h2>

<p>I worked with Python almost 10 years ago when I was learning to code. I enjoyed it, but the wave was frontend; the framework wars were brewing and I was caught up in the hype, such as this:</p>

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxcRxZpUJWo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p><em>No offense to Kent, but this is certianly one of the videos of all time</em></p>

<p>There was a very <em>chic</em> mystic about frontend engineering and I fell into it, even though <a href="https://www.tiffanywhite.dev/posts/final-thoughts">I really didn’t like it</a>.</p>

<p>I kept up with it, made my bones and bacon in and with it, lost jobs with it, but I remained in that space, hating every bit of it.</p>

<p>I began to get angry at the very thought of something breaking because 10 million upstream dependenices depended on this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/has.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Which is just checking to see if there is some property on an object. This is basically one line of code that is an upstream dependency on millions of projects. That’s just one example.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to rant here, just trying to set context. Anyway.</p>

<h2 id="simple-scripts-and-their-lack-of-being-simple">Simple scripts and their lack of being simple</h2>

<p>I’m back to using Python to write a simple DDoS script.</p>

<p>I’ve spent majority of my time on GitHub repos doing similar things, in the Python docs, and writing, overengineering, then simplifying the script.</p>

<p>There are bizarre errors I am not familiar with, however I am lucky to have a good friend to pair program with, who has been helpful.</p>

<p>You can find the script on my repo.</p>

<p>Say you want to run multiple machines you want to destroy with malware, run amok attacking it’s network with Kali tools. How to best do that? Why, VMs of course!</p>

<p>I asked them if I could do a few pen tests on their sites to practice my limited skills. They gave me permission, albeit spoken permission which means I will need to get explicit permission in writing before I start, break something important, get sued, and lose friends.</p>

<!--truncate-->

<p>Where to start? Easy. SQL injection.</p>

<h2 id="first-foray-into-pen-testing-a-site">First foray into pen testing a site</h2>

<p>My friend hired a lazy developer to create her website. It was hosted on a strange host without SSL enabled which was a huge red flag for me.</p>

<p>They were frustrated by his lack of progress developing the site and I was curious about the developer and what stack he used, and, if possible, see if I could break into the site.</p>

<h2 id="jquery-and-angular">jQuery and Angular</h2>

<p>The site used a mishmash of jQuery and Angular. My first inclination was to find the authentication page. How? DevTools. Easy enough. Find the route that leads to the auth. The route was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/login.js</code>.</p>

<p>I clicked the file in DevTools which miraculously took me right to the login page, which was also unencrypted.</p>

<p>I tried what I knew about SQL injection.</p>

<p>I entered a random character in the username and password fields. What returned was an error but nothing that I could work with; there was no information about the database revealed in the error in the UI.</p>

<p>I didn’t give up hope.</p>

<p>I did some more digging and found the developer of the site on LinkedIn, his information freely available on there. I had his email, now all I would need is a way to guess his password to the site.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, I didn’t have any password dumps from pastebin or a place like that. All the regular easy passwords didn’t work either, and I didn’t have Kali setup with a tool to compare password hashes and break the encryption to suss out possible passwords.</p>

<p>Still, it was a fun exercise from someone not knowing what they were doing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Your Name</name><email>tiff-0x8c@proton.me</email></author><category term="security" /><category term=" web" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spelunking for fun]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Check Out My Cyber Notes</title><link href="/check-out-my-evergreen-notes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Check Out My Cyber Notes" /><published>2022-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/check-out-my-evergreen-notes</id><content type="html" xml:base="/check-out-my-evergreen-notes/"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve heard of <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> and you’ve heard of a <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">digital garden</a> then you’re already halfway to understanding the premise.</p>
